# joule-ecosystem-model
Developing a joule-based economic model to simulate and analyze energy flows in a sustainable and equitable future.  Includes research, data, and code.
This project explores the revolutionary concept of a **joule-based economy**, where energy, measured in joules, becomes the fundamental unit of value.  We believe this approach has the potential to create a more sustainable, equitable, and human-centered economic system.

**Key Goals:**

* **Develop a comprehensive joule-based economic model:**  This model will simulate energy flows, production, consumption, and distribution within a global economy where the joule is the primary unit of account.
* **Enhance Earth System Models (ESMs):**  We will integrate joule-based calculations into existing ESMs to improve their accuracy and predictive capabilities, allowing for a better understanding of the Earth's energy dynamics and the impact of human activities.
* **Build an interactive platform:**  We will create a user-friendly platform to visualize and interact with the model, enabling users to explore different scenarios, understand energy flows, and contribute to the project's development.
* **Develop a joule-backed cryptocurrency:** We will explore the creation of a cryptocurrency backed by energy (joules), potentially through renewable energy production or human energy expenditure.
* **Communicate our findings:** We will publish our research findings in academic journals and create a multimedia book to share this vision with a wider audience.

**Join the Journey:**

We invite researchers, developers, and anyone passionate about sustainability and economic innovation to join us on this journey.  Explore the code, data, and documentation in this repository, and contribute your expertise to help us build a more sustainable and equitable future.
